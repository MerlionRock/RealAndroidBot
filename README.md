## Changelog
### RAB 1.07
**NOTE:** Due to the recent announcement by Polygon#, we will be removing Network mode of Polygon# from RAB. What does this mean? It mean Polygon# users will no longer be able to teleport to exactly where pokestops/pokemon are. No longer able to automatically capture shiny or 100 Polygon# found. All features of Polygon# will be removed.

Due to this sudden changes, we are unable to fully optimize support for Polygon# users and you might see your avatar stuck at different places frequently. As such I suggest you switch to Pokemod temporary.

- Added send enounter/caught information to Discord
- Changed default `spin_pokestop` from false to true
- Bug Fix: Team Rocket manage pokemon button not recognized 
- Bug Fix: Not feeding berries
- Auto scripts for Windows User to simplify installation process
- Remove network setting for Polygon#. Now Polygon# will work just like HAL. 
- Options orginally meant for Polygon# are removed
- Added only_shiny mode. Also known as shiny tap. It will only catch if poke is shiny, else flee.
- Added navigation_offset option. For phones with buttons and you can't disable/remove them, we now have an option for you to remove it. Set the height of your navigation bar here.
